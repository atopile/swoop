## What is swoopðŸ›«?

With swoop, you can fly remote controlled aircraft with the motion of your hand. It's especially fun when flying FPV because the motion of your drone precisely maps to the movement of the remote.

## Open Source Hardware..?

This project is fully open source. But one might ask, how can it be open source if "source code" doesn't exist for hardware in the same way that it exists in software with languages like C, Python or Rust? Well, that's why we are designing this remote with [atopile](https://github.com/atopile/atopile), a new language and compiler for electronics. With atopile, we can now version control the hardware alongside the firmware, make issues and pull requests, run continuous integration to generate manufacturing files and reuse section of the design. True Open Source Hardware!

## So, how does it work?

The three rotation axis, yaw, pitch, roll of the remote each control the same control channel on the aircraft. So if you tilt your remote to a certain angle, your aircraft will start rotating in that same direction at a certain rotational speed. That's what makes this controller so intuitive to use! To start using the remote, simply double click the arming button (the larger button). This will zero the controller to the current position and start streaming the control outputs to the receiver.

To control the throttle, which is your aircraft's motor power, simply press the trigger. Inside the controller, a hall sensor precisely keeps track of the trigger position. This makes for a total of four control inputs with yaw, pitch, roll and throttle.

The smaller button on the remote let's you switch the flight mode. Pretty handy to tweak how your aircraft reacts to your control inputs!

Lastly, the remote has an integrated transceiver from the popular open source ExpressLRS project, which makes it compatible with any of their receivers!

## Feature list

Here is what we are planning for this controller:

- Yaw, pitch and roll control angles from the motion of your hand
- Throttle control through the trigger
- Arming button (sets zero position and turn control inputs on/off)
- Flight mode button
- Embedded ExpressLRS transceiver
- Rechargeable over USB-C

## Documentation

We will update this section as we make progress with the project. In the meantime,
